# HoloGuide
_A research project exploring the use of AR in emergencies._

## Origins
The project was created during an internal Autodesk Hackathon. It was inspired by the excellent 3D sound capability in the HoloLens platform: the idea being that potentially it could be used to guide visually impaired people to the nearest exit during an emergency.
